In this Repository, I have created a StopWatch web application. By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is used to structure the elements of the application.

By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch.

It includes tracking and displaying lap times,so that users can accurately measure and record time intervals.

It is an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch webÂ application.
